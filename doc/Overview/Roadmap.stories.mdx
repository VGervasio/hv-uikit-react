# Roadmap

The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the list below should give a clear indication of our top priorities for the next major release, and for the future:

<br />

## Top priorities

- **Design System Alignment:** The Design System like the UI Kit, is a living project, which means patterns and themes evolve. The alignment with the most recent guidelines is our top priority.

- **Accessibility:** We target our development and tests to meet the WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 guidelines.

- **New Components and Features:** New patterns and features are continuously added always aligned with the most recent DS guidelines and the existent priorities.

- **Promote Components from Lab to Core:** All the Lab components that reach a maturity level and follows the defined compliance requirements should be promoted to the core package.

- **Localization and i18n:** All our components support labels replacement in order to allow localization scenarios.

- **Responsiveness:** Most of our patterns are adjustable to the provided Grid System. We keep investing in making sure the components can behave correctly in responsive scenarios.

## Next Version - **V5.x**

Having reached a point of stability and maturity we have approached v5 as an opportunity to unlock the next stage of growth.

In our continuous effort to keep the UI Kit library as valuable as possible to our users, these are the top priorities for the next version:

- **Next Design System**: Following the latest DS release (5.x) we will review all components to be fully aligned with the most recent guidelines.
- **Theming system**: We are working on a new theming system that will allow us to unlock two major issues identified for a long time: reduce the gap between DS and UI Kit releases and improve our customisation capabilities, allowing the UI Kit to be easily used in different design scenarios.

Continuing the core work of the UI Kit we’ll also be actively working on:

- **Components** - We’ll keep adding new components that provide value, but since the styling system will be replaced, we’ll be mostly focused on a a deep revision of the existent components (not expecting major API changes).
- **Templates** - We’ll keep investing and improving our templates in order to ease the implementation of common use cases.
- **Typescript**: Right now the typescript definitions the UI Kit library provides are manually authored. We are moving to fully integrate Typescript in the library.

**Timeframe**

The UI Kit 5 is planned to be released around March 2023. We are deeply committed to this target, as we know how important it is for our users to be able to plan in a timely manner the adoption of new UI Kit versions.
In the beginning of Jan 2023, we plan to make available Alpha versions of our packages for those who might be interested in starting to integrate and test new features.

As always, your feedback, comments and suggestions are welcome. Stay tuned!
