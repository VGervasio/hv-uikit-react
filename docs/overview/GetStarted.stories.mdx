# Get Started

## Installation

NEXT UI Kit uses [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) as its default styling engine and [MUI](https://mui.com/) as a core dependency.

To use NEXT UI Kit in your project, run the following command:

```
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-core @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/material
```

### Peer dependencies

`react` >= 17.0.0 and `react-dom` >= 17.0.0 are also peer dependencies and should already be included in your project.

## Usage

### 1. Set up the provider

After installing the core package, you'll need to setup the `HvProvider`, which can be imported from `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core`,
and wrap your application with it like so:

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return <HvProvider>{children}</HvProvider>;
};
```

This will initialize the UI Kit with the `Design System 5`theme and the `dawn` color mode by default. Depending on your design requirements, you may need to customize or use other themes.

For more information, please report to the [**provider**](/docs/guides-provider--main#provider)
and [**theming**](/docs/guides-theming-theming--main#theming) documentation.

### 2. Load the default font

The UI Kit uses **Open Sans** as its default font family since it is the one defined by the Design System specifications. Thus, you'll need to ensure the font
is loaded properly since the UI Kit can't do it automatically.

This can be achieved through the **Google Web Fonts CDN** by using the following code inside your project's `<head>` tag:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Please, report to the [**typography**](/docs/foundation-typography--main) documentation for more information.

### 3. Use the components

After setting up the provider and load the font, you can start using the components provided by the UI Kit core package like so:

```tsx
import { HvTypography } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <HvTypography>Hello from the UI Kit team!</HvTypography>;
};
```

## Use an example project

In the UI Kit's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react) you can find inside the [`/examples` folder](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/tree/next-mirage/examples)
some example projects that can get you quickly started with UI Kit. You only need to download the example, install the dependencies, and run the project.

At the moment, you can find the following example projects:

- [Vite.js with TypeScript](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/tree/next-mirage/examples/uikit-vite-ts)

In the future, we will work toward providing more examples.
